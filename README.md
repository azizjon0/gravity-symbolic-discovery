> Can a neural-symbolic model rediscover the laws that a 3-year-old can intuitively grasp?

## 🧠 Why This Project?

This project was born from a single question:

> “If children can discover Newton's laws intuitively by age 3…  
> ...could a machine do the same, with no prior physics knowledge?”

Inspired by this thought, I built a system that uses **symbolic regression** to rediscover physical laws such as:

- \( a = g \)
- \( a = \frac{2h}{t^2} \)
- \( F = ma \)

The result?  
✅ It works — **three separate models**, each learning a core physical equation from data, with near-perfect accuracy.
